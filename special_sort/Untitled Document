Your mission
Write a script sort_it.py that reads the standard entry, puts all lines into an array and sorts the array with the function special_sort. The script will then output the resulting array.

You have to import the special_sort function from the sorts module, which we will provide.

Signature
When the special_sort function raises a RuntimeError, your script should display I catch a RuntimeError!. RuntimeError is the only Exception you should catch.

﻿﻿Here is the signature of the special_sort function you will use:

def special_sort(array):
	"""Given an array as argument, this function sorts it efficiently and returns the sorted array.

	>>> special_sort(["Hello, my name", "is", "MENU"])
	["Hello, my name", "MENU", "is"]

	If the function encounters an error while executing, it will raise a RuntimeError.

	>>> special_sort(["I hope it will", "work"])
  	I catch a RuntimeError!
  	"""

Example

$ python3 sort_it.py
Hello, my name
is
MENU

["Hello, my name", "MENU", "is"]
$ python3 sort_it.py
I hope it will
work

I catch a RuntimeError!


How to test it?
The sorts module isn't part of the standard Python library, it's our own module that the Sentinel will import to test if you know how to catch a given exception.

To test your solution, you can create your own sorts module. It's easy: by default Python will look for an unknown module in the current directory.
