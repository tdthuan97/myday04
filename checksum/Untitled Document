Your mission
A checksum is a series of numbers and letters derived from a block of data. You calculate it by applying an algorithm on a block of data. The MD5 algorithm is frequently used for that purpose.

Write a script checksum.py that will produce the md5 checksums for all files in a given directory. The directory name will passed as an argument to your script. The checksums will be written in a file called checksums, and they will be sorted by file name.

You will use the md5 function from the hashlib library.
