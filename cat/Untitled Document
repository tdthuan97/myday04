Your mission
By now you should be familiar with the cat shell utility. Your job today is to reproduce its usage without options.

Your cat.py program will concatenate and output the files passed as arguments. If no argument is given, your program will read and output the content of the standard entry.

$ echo "I'm on standard entry !" | python3 cat.py
I'm on standard entry !
$ echo -n "I'm in a file" > test
$ cat test
I'm in a file$ python3 cat.py test
I'm in a file$

Hint
Look into what the echo -n option does to understand what's happening and how you should handle the output.
