Your mission
ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher (a way to encrypt a message) that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. Today you will code a rot-x cipher that replaces a letter with the x-th letter after it in the alphabet.

Write a function that takes two arguments: the first one is a string, the second one is by how many characters it should be rotated. By default the second argument should be 13.

It will return the rotated string.

Your function must be named rotx and in the file named rotx.py.

>>> rotx("Toan is a great cook!")
'Gbna vf n terng pbbx!'

>>> rotx("Hello!", 1)
'Ifmmp!'
