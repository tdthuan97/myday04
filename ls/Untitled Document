Your mission
You are super familiar with the ls utility by now, right? Cool, let's recode it!

Your function must be named ls and in the file named ls.py.

To calculate the width of the columns, you should follow those rules:

If the longest path is wider than the width of the terminal => you will output everything on a single column
Else, every column will have the width of the longest path + 1 (for the space)

def ls(term_width):
    """
    List the current directory's contents.

    The list is printed and should have the same output as `ls` (without arguments).
    """
